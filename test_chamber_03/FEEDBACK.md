NOTES.md

Annoying to install on a mac
PyCharm not needed
No debugger in the docker env
Docker Toolbox is deprecated
Traefik is on v2 now
I did not know about httpie, it's a nice tool !
print would not log in docker logs
Point is not JSON serialable
url() is deprecated in 3.1
django is now in version 3.1.7, far from the 2.0.5
why get rid of the POST single element ? I moved it to POST assets/new just in case
No constraint was given on the Django version: bumping to 3.1.7 to use djangorestframework==3.12.4 for input validation
downgrading to django 2.2 due to `no such function: lwgeom_version`
This error is not present in docker, continuing with docker
Mmm just realized the POST should accept bulk and single elements
